FRC Robot program designed to control FRC Team 9105's 2024 build-season robot Synth - an SDS MK4i L2 NEO Motor swerve drive. The robot was designed for the 2024 FRC Season's game: Cresdendo.

**üè∑Ô∏è Author's Note**: Synth no work right now, current code in shambles; thus we ball

Once the robot code is fairly complete I will update the README.
